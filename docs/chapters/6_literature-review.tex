% General Literature introduction
    The state of a robot such as position, orientation, velocity, acceleration, parameters or even a map, is critical to get accurate results. 
    Needless to mention, the more information the robot knows about itself, the solution to find unknowns becomes easier. 
    In the context of SLAM, pose information and the map of the environment are the states of absolute interest. 
    Given the high precision pose information of the robot, then the problem simplifies to mapping of the environment with known pose.Here the state of interest is 
    only the map which does not even require state estimation rather use the available mapping algorithm to draw the Map of the environment. 
    On the other hand, given the Map of the environment, then the problem reduces to localization problem with data association in certain cases. 
    Here the state of interest is pose and the correspondence for data association. A survey on various \textit{SLAM} methods were presented by 
    \cite{C.Cadena} and \cite{T.Takleh}. According to \cite{C.Cadena}, the history of SLAM is broadly classified into \textit{classical age} 
    consisting of \textit{Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)} methods, \textit{Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF)} methods and \textit{Maximum Likelihood Estimation}. 
    Followed by \textit{algorithmic-analysis age} which predominantly studied observability, convergence and consistency of SLAM, 
    leading to efficient SLAM solvers and many open source libraries. Followed by \textit{robust-perception age} which focuses on robust performance, 
    Resource awareness, high level understanding and task-driven perception.Finally in my perspective, with the development and up-rise in the application of 
    Deep Learning techniques in SLAM, it would be suitable to term the current trend as \textit{Machine Learning era of SLAM}

% SLAM - Kalman Filter based
    In the beginning, hardware capabilities were very less and compute power embedded in mobile robots were limited to fewer processes at an instance. Hence the choice of sensors to be mounted on 
    the robots were very critical. Historically the very first feasible solution to the SLAM problem proposed the use of Extended Kalman Filters(EKFs) by estimating the joint posterior distribution 
    over pose of the robot and the landmark positions.Kalman Filters are widely used state estimators but are limited to linear system and works on the assumption of Gaussian distribution of data.
    Therefore they cannot be directly applied to solve the non-linear SLAM problems. By linearizing the data at the mean of the distribution it is possible to approximate the solution, the Extended
    Kalman Filter works on this principle. The state estimate and the associated uncertainty are provided by the mean and covariance matrix of the posterior of the joint probability. 
    However the odometric drift observed by the robot seems to hold down the accuracy of the posterior estimate.\cite{J.Kang} proposed  modified 
    Neural Network aided EKF (mNNEKF) to improve the accuracy of the estimate by compensating for odometric error of the robot using Neural Network. This method claims to work well even under
    colored noise and systematic bias error.

% Another cool thing about \LaTeX~is its referencing system. This template is set up to use harvard-style referencing. You can do this by using \texttt{\textbackslash citep\{citekey\}}. It will print out something like this: \citep{aad2012observation}. Or alternatively, you can use \texttt{\textbackslash cite\{citekey\}} to cite things like this: \cite{chatrchyan2012observation}. This template uses Bib\LaTeX~for referencing, with a Biber backend. This is primarily due to the extensive features Bib\LaTeX~provides, along with the option of glossaries. If you want to customise the referencing style, you can either modify the template slightly to use different options, or use \texttt{\textbackslash usepackage} again to reimport it. There's probably some commands to change its options after its been imported too.

% \section{Ludography}
% This thesis template also contains an optional ludography. This is primarily for Games Development students, who wish to cite games in their thesis. To use this, just put references into your bib file as usual with the game's details. Then, make sure \texttt{keywords} is set to \texttt{\{game\}}. This is what is used to determine which references are games, and which are actual papers. For a more elaborate example, see \texttt{bib/ludography.bib}.

% Also, make sure that the \texttt{title} key is actually the author of the game, and the \texttt{author} is the title of the game. The reason this is swapped around is because Bib\LaTeX~likes to print references out with the author first. Then, just add \texttt{\textbackslash printLudography} with an optional title argument to print out all citations like \texttt{\textbackslash printLudography} or \texttt{\textbackslash printLudography[Games]}.

% You can also use the \texttt{ludography} environment if you wish to print out some text before the list of games is printed. An example of this can be seen in \texttt{main.tex}. To cite games, you can \texttt{\textbackslash cite} it like any other reference. However, if you want it to display the title instead of the standard referencing style, you can use \texttt{\textbackslash citeGame} instead.

% Here is an example of a cited game with a normal reference style: ~\cite{spaceinvaders}. Ugh, pretty ugly. Instead, here the two are  cited in the next sentence as games with \texttt{\textbackslash citeGame}. Both \citeGame{spaceinvaders} and \citeGame{breakout} were games made by Atari. Much better!
