The analysis in the previous chapter show that ICP-LS provides better results in terms of accuracy and computation efficiency.The evaluation was only performed over one dataset but could be easily extended  against various datasets.

The study and implementation provide understanding on how efficient are the scan matching algorithms with the current system of particle filter based SLAM. It is also to be noted that the implementation could also be made more efficient with better coding practises or even choice of programming language. The performance could also change cast if the scan matching algorithms are used and evaluated with different approaches of SLAM such as graph based SLAM. This work provides a ground from which many scan matching algorithms can be implemented and evaluated.
