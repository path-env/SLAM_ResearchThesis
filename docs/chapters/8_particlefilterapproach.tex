\section{Introduction}
    Paramtetric filters such as EKF work on the assumption that posterior density is Gaussian paramterized by mean and covariance. In cases where the 
true density is non Gaussian, these filters fail to describe the actual posterior.In many practical applications, linear and gaussian assumptions would
not hold true, hence better approaches are required to describe the posterior density. Particle Filters are non paramteric filters which can model 
any posteriror distribution as it does not assume gaussian requiring mean and covariance. This chapter provides in-depth view of Particle Filters and
its application to SLAM.

\section{Particle Filter}
Particle Filters manage to model the required distribution by use of samples sampled from the distribution. However no a-prior information about the 
distribution is known. Hence a proposal distribution is used as a inital guess to sample particles from it and weigh it against the target distribution.
This process is repeated until the proposal distribution matches the target distribution and it requires resampling from the proposal distribution as
required.The samples which weigh more are more likely to describe the target distribution. This leads to further discussion on what could be the guess 
on proposal distribution, how is it sampled and how is it resampled.

\subsection{Sample}
Sampling in particle filters in based on Sequential Importance Sampling principle and Sequential Monte-Carlo methods. Samples in genral are generated in 
random from a proposal distribution. The more samples we are able to sample , the better is the approximation of the target distribution. With larger 
number of samples, Monte-Carlo methods provide equivalent representation of the target distribution and Sequential Importance Sampling approaches optimal
Bayes estimate \cite{S.Arulampalam}.
