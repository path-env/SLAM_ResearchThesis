% What will be displayed in the header: the assessment item
\thesisHeaderContents{Research Thesis}

% Uncommenting the \thesisTurnOffHF line below will remove your name + id from the footer
% as well as removing the header contents. It is NOT recommended to do this
% as the presentation policy for assessed work in the SoCS requires
% these both of these. However, you may want to uncomment this for other
% reasons: i.e. when printing a personal copy which is NOT going to be
% submitted.
